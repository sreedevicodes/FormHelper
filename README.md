# Forms Helper

## Basic Details

### Team Name: KACHRA

### Hosted Project Link
git@github.com:sreedevicodes/FormHelper.git

### Project Description
Form Helper is a browser extension that assists users while filling out web forms.  
It scans forms on any webpage, walks through each empty or incomplete field, and provides inline help and smart suggested values so users can complete forms faster and with fewer errors.

### The Problem statement
Many users find long or complex forms confusing and time‑consuming.  
They are often unsure what is expected in each field, leading to mistakes, rejections, or simply abandoning the form.

### The Solution
The Form Helper extension automatically detects forms and applies a guided, field‑by‑field flow (as designed in the workflow diagram).  
For each field, it checks whether the value is empty or invalid, shows helpful guidance, and optionally proposes a suggested value that the user can accept or ignore before moving on to the next field.

## Implementation

### For Software (Browser Extension):

#### Installation (Development)
1. Clone or download this repository to your machine.
2. **Configure Gemini API (Optional but Recommended):**
   - Get your free Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Open `config.js` in the FormHelper folder
   - Paste your API key: `GEMINI_API_KEY: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"`
   - The extension will use AI-powered suggestions. Without an API key, it falls back to rule-based suggestions.
3. Open your browser (Chrome/Edge/Brave) and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
4. Enable **Developer mode**.
5. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `FormHelper` folder containing `manifest.json`.

#### Usage
1. Visit any website that contains a form.
2. Once the page loads, the **Form Helper** overlay appears in the bottom‑right corner if form fields are detected.
3. The helper highlights one field at a time:
   - **Use suggestion**: fills the field with a context‑aware suggested value (e.g., sample email, phone, name).
   - **Fill myself**: skips the suggestion and lets the user type manually.
   - **Ignore**: skips the field without changes.
4. After all empty/incomplete fields are processed, the overlay shows a completion message so the user can review and submit the form.
